# V1 Walk-and-Fix — Iteration Log

**Spec:** `docs/v1-walk-and-fix-design.md`
**Status:** Loop active. Day 0 setup complete.

## Locked walk script

```
1. dashboard login: qa@buildrik.local / qa-test-1234 (seeded via prisma/seed.ts)
2. dashboard → create site "test-site-N" (N = iteration number)
3. click "Open in editor"
4. editor: add Section → add Heading → add Image (from media tab) → add Button → save
5. editor: Publish dropdown → publish to Vercel
6. wait for live URL → open in new tab → verify 4 elements visible
7. close editor → reopen → verify 4 elements still present
```

## Triage rules

| Severity | Definition | Loop action |
|---|---|---|
| P0 — crash | console.error or uncaught exception breaks flow | Stop. Fix this iteration. |
| P0 — data loss | User edit doesn't persist after save | Stop. Fix this iteration. |
| P1 — flow break | Step fails but workaround exists | Fix after all P0 drained. |
| P2 — cosmetic / slow | Looks bad, works | Log to V1_POST_DEFERRED.md. Out of v1 scope. |
